# Readme.md HW-2

1. *Assignments*
  - This week I downloaded the apps **Atom** and **Git**.
  - I played with the test file to make sure that my directory is linked to the class repository and I'm able to track and commit changes using either Powershell or the **Github Desktop** app.
  - Then I produced this readme file using **markdown** syntax.

2. *Steps / Useful Tricks*
  - I found it helped to go back and skim the lessons to make sure I completed all the tasks.  There was so much content and I always felt like I missed something.
  - I also saved snips of the basic commands so I could use them in Powershell.
  - And I kept the test markdown file as a cheatsheet next to my work on this file.

3.  *Issues*
  - After I downloaded Git, I entered `git --version` into Powershell and it sent back nothing.  I followed the suggestion to restart Powershell, then retyped the command and it worked perfectly.
  - I opened Atom and my screen went black.  I thought it crashed my computer and I nearly fell off my stool.  But my battery had just died and my computer was fine.
  - I didn't upload these issues since they were quickly resolved.

4. *Learned*
  - I learned that I don't mind Powershell so much but I prefer the upfront graphic interface of Github Desktop for tracking versions and committing changes.  I like to see the changes highlighted on a white screen.
  - But I still like to use Powershell to make new directories and files.  It seems much faster than using a GUI app.
  - I also realized that I've done some of this coding before.  I took a class a few years ago on HTML and CSS and built a website.  So I'm relieved that some of this course will be familiar.
  - I liked the video by Jackk1337 and saw he posted other videos.  I searched him and stumbled on a [deviantart](https://jackk1337.deviantart.com/) page from when he was 16.

5.  *Help*
  - I wasn't able to help anyone on the forum.  I was a bit slow this week working through the content and apps.
