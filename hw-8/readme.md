#### *Looping Pattern*
I first created a pattern of squares with randomly changing colors.  Then I wanted to make a more complex pattern with ellipses but I decided on triangles instead.  I kept the triangles black and the geometric design with the toned down pastel colors behind looked like a mid-century modern geometric pattern.

That gave me the idea to use ellipses after all.  I played with their size and location until it made sense to fit them perfectly between the triangles to make them look like a sun between mountain peaks.

I changed the background from a gray to black and then gave the triangles the same shifting colors.  To create contrast I made the color values darker for the triangles and brighter for the ellipses.  So the suns would be bright and the mountains would be shadowed.

Of course I turned the frame rate down to be able to watch the colors change comfortably.  And I adjusted the canvas to fit the pattern.

The only issue I had was when I tried to get the triangles to rotate with each color change.  I couldn't get it to work with the loops.  But I abandoned the idea to create the sun and mountain pattern instead.
